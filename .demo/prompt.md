Can you look at the #codebase and help me document my project:

create a ./docs/index.md add a description of the project and link to all the other docs
in architecture can you:
add a file to document the databases information: the various supported db, and use the production schema (MySQL) to create a new ERD using mermaid, followed by the list of tables and fields and description and index
add a document with all the classes using UML diagram of the project
add the Web part that list all the REST API and endpoints, an also all the pages and navigation (create a schema)
